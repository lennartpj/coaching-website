# 🛣️ Roadmap Checklist to Build the Business Website

---

### 1. ✅ **Project Initialization (Done!)**
- [x] Initialize project with `create-next-app` (app directory + Tailwind + TypeScript + ESLint + alias `@/*`)
- [x] Use `src/` folder structure
- [x] Accept using Turbopack for faster development
- [x] Git repository initialized

---

### 2. 🎨 **Basic Setup**
- [ ] **Configure `tsconfig.json`** for import aliases (`@/*`)
- [ ] **Confirm Tailwind config** (`content: ['./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}']`)
- [ ] **Create global styles** (`src/styles/globals.css`) if not already done
- [ ] **Setup basic layout**:
  - `src/app/layout.tsx` → Navbar + Footer + children
  - `src/app/page.tsx` → Homepage

---

### 3. 🛠️ **Essential Pages**
- [ ] Home (`/`)
- [ ] Contact (`/contact`)
- [ ] Services (`/services`) — Describe coaching services
- [ ] About (`/about`) — Who your friend is, his background
- [ ] Privacy Policy (`/privacy`) — Required in Germany!
- [ ] (Optional) Imprint / Impressum (`/impressum`) — Also required legally in Germany

---

### 4. 🧩 **Core Components**
- [ ] `Navbar.tsx`
- [ ] `Footer.tsx`
- [ ] `Button.tsx` (Optional: reusable button component)
- [ ] `ContactForm.tsx` (for the contact page. )

---

### 5. 💬 **Contact Form Setup**
- [ ] Build a simple form (Name, Email, Message)
- [ ] For email handling:
  - **Advanced Option**: Build Cloudflare Functions (Serverless Functions).

---

### 6. 📱 **Responsive Design**
- [ ] Make sure the site looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop using Tailwind responsive classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).

---

### 7. 🛡️ **Legal Pages (Important for Germany!)**
- [ ] **Impressum** (Imprint)
- [ ] **Datenschutzerklärung** (Privacy Policy)
- [ ] Cookie Banner if you track any user data (Google Analytics, etc.)

---

### 8. 🚀 **Polishing**
- [ ] Add SEO basic settings (`next/head`, meta tags)
- [ ] Add favicon
- [ ] Improve page loading speeds (optimize images, use Next.js `<Image>` component)
- [ ] Check accessibility (color contrast, alt texts)

Would you also like me to prepare a **"starter project folder structure"** you can copy into your project, so you don’t have to think too much about where to put files? 🚀  
(Like a little "project architecture" ready to go!)  
Let’s keep the momentum!
